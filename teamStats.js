/**
 * Team Stats
 * 
 * We want to create and extract information about your favorite sports team. Basketball, 
 * soccer, tennis, or water polo, you pick it. Itâ€™s your job to create data using the 
 * JavaScript data structures at your disposal: arrays, objects, etc.
 *
 * Once created, you can manipulate these data structures as well as gain insights from 
 * them. For example, you might want to get the total number of games your team has 
 * played, or the average score of all of their games.
