# Simple JavaScript Projects
### About
Projects from codecademy for learning JS.
### Notable Projects
* lodash was the most difficult one.
* mysteriousOrganism I had the most fun with.
* In whaleTalk and paperScissorsRock, I encountered JS's asynchronous nature.
I had to use a promise within an async function to emulate a synchronous program 
that takes user input, produces an output, then repeats. Uncertain if this is 
the proper method, but I believe JS isn't really a language built for this.
### Technology
JavaScript and Node.js
### Status
Projects are finished, but as usual, there is always room to improve code.
